# A-directory-of-integer-sequences
## Description :
This project is the first time approach towards building a system of understanding of Integer Sequences in Mathematics.

This projects consists of Python scripts that whenn executed prints out a little description of the selected sequence. And when the input N be given, it'll print out the N terms of that sequence. 

- Online LIbraries like OEIS have been a great help when building this project and this could be a contribution to that as it is dynamic and allows you to analyze the growth of the Sequence as the terms grow.

- this project aims at getting a better understanding of the Mathematics of Sequences

## Future Prospects 

- Looking forward to be able to add visualisation of the sequence.
- inference of the Space and Time Complexity of each of the sequences to gain a better understanding of the cnocepts as well
